# C-ConsoleBlackJack
This is another console game that I made but instead I wanted to use C++. I decided to make a blackjack game that supports multiple players. Like typical blackjack, the program gets input from each user on whether or not they would like to 'hit' or not until they refuse or bust. When every player has finished inputing their decisions, the dealers hand will reveal and determine who wins, ties, and loses. Each player will have a running score accosiated with them as well. You gain one point for winning, one point for losing, and stay the same when tying. The user is asked if they would like to play another game or not, if so, a new set is drawn and another round is played with the running score. If the user would not like to play another game, the program ends.

The program uses a rand function to determine the cards that get passed to both the dealer and the player. The graphical UI is represented on the console using a X,Y coordinate system that allows players to be of the same line along with other functions happening with writing to the console.
